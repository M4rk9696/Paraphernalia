# Cuckoo POW

**Status:** May or may not work

This is heavily copied from the original implementation, idea was to implement this is C to get more experience in C, all credits to the [cuckoo](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo) project

Understanding Cuckoo Cycles by trying to recontruct the POW algorithm

Wrote the verifier in C based on the Java implementation and a mix of the CPP implementation.

This may not work.
